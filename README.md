# Business Review Platform – Frontend

A React-based web application that allows users to browse, search,  
and filter business reviews through a clean, responsive interface.  

This project serves as the client-side component of a full-stack  
review system and communicates with a RESTful backend API  
to retrieve and display data dynamically.

## Overview

The goal of this project was to design a modern frontend  
for a business review platform that feels intuitive and responsive.  

Users can browse listings, filter by location,  
and interact with dynamically rendered review data  
pulled from a backend service.

One challenge was handling asynchronous API requests  
while maintaining consistent application state  
across filtered pages.  

Implemented Redux improved state predictability  
and simplified data flow.
